## Overview
This project is a basic farming simulator modeled after Stardew Valley with the core focus on the farming mechanic. You can plant seeds, water plants and harvest them after watering them enough (just drown them in water and they'll eventually auto harvest). There is a money mechanic, where you go to the shop to buy seeds and watering cans with your coins. You can also sell your crops for coins. There is also a NPC who you can bribe with coins in exchange for their friendship. There is also a water variable and needing to fetch more water from the pond. The heart system is the end goal (to get 10 hearts and earn the NPC's friendship). The inventory contains the items you have (like watering can, seeds and harvested crops) and you click on items in the inventory to switch to that mode (click watering can to go to watering mode). 
## Instructions
Most of the key bindings are on the screen (press s to shop) and we started off the game with 20 water (so the watering game is optional, which should make playing faster). Click on most things to get more instructions or do things. The only thing that doesn't have instructions is how to fetch water (click on the pond on the left hand side to get more water).
