Farming Our Lives Awayyyyyyy!! üôÅ
## Overview
This project is a basic farming simulator modeled after Stardew Valley with the core focus on the farming mechanic. You can plant seeds, water plants and harvest them after watering them enough (just drown them in water and they'll eventually auto harvest). There is a money mechanic, where you go to the shop to buy seeds and watering cans with your coins. You can also sell your crops for coins (to upgrade your house). There is also a NPC who you can bribe with either coins or your harvested crops in exchange for their friendship. There is also a water variable and a mini game to fetch more water.
## Instructions
Most of the key bindings are on the screen (press s to shop) and we started off the game with 20 water (so the watering game is optional, which should make playing faster).
